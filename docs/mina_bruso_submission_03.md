I added the admin group and admin django page. We ensured that only admin users had access to this page - not the general users - and that when we changed the data on the page, it was displayed properly on the main website. To get to the admin page, we have to manually navigate to `localhost:8080/admin` in the address bar.

I also contributed to the submission_03.md writeup, as well as made minor asthetic modifications to the website.
