I created the Store and Item data models, with a one-to-many relationship from Stores to unique Items. 
I also created the List Views for Stores and Items_Cart, and made the URLs work. 
I created the HTML for the the Store List View and Items_Cart List View.
I also created the Stores button on the navbar in base_generic.html.
Lastly, I helped merge my code with Harold's on github.
