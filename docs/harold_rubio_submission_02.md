In this project, I set up the initial django project and pushed the directory that we would all work on, to the GitHub. Then, I redesigned my UI into the homepage and set up URLs for the different HTML pages that we planned to have. I also programmed the corresponding views. After, I helped merge everyone's individual HTML files and URL implementations into a single django project with consistent models. I also created base_generic to have a navbar and set placeholders for everyone to put their URLs into.
