# Overview of Application
Our application "Down the Aisle" effectively will allow users to login, select the store they want to make a shopping list for, be able to search for the items they want, put them into their cart, and finally generate a map showing where each item is and the fastest route to get it. What we implemented includes loading mock users that are able to login and view unique data to that user as well as modifying data. For our application, we updated how some of the functionality of the search bar works and various other little changes to accommodate the implementation of mock users and user interaction.

# Design Overview
We implemented simple login functionality. When the user is logged in, they will have access to "My Profile", and "Add Item to Favorites" on the navbar at the top. "My Profile" has general user data such as username and password, and some statistics about their favorite stores and shopping lists. "Add Item to Favorites" takes the user to a form to add items to the cart. Right now it's setup so that the user types in the item they want to add to their list, but ideally we would have it so that the user can select the item from a store to add to their list. 

# Problems/Successes
Getting the data to be unique for each user was difficult to implement and get working properly. The user interatction part was also difficult and there were a lot of road blocks that presented themselves. It all came together in the end though. In addition, we ran into some issues involving having enough time to complete what we want to complete with the break happening right before the submission. However, we were able to successfully implement what was required and have all the functionality working. A good amount of the time we felt rushed and time crunched but it worked out in the end and everyone worked well together. For the last stretch of the semester, we all will need to make sure that we will have enough time to finalize the application.

# Team Choice
We're thinking the last item we'd like to have working properly is password reset.
