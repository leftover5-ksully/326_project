I contributed to the task breakdown at the beginning of the project and helping delegate who was responsible for what models, and features of the application.
I also helped with the URL mappings and views, I edited some of the content on the homepage html, mainly with the help of Harold.
Lastly I contributed to creating the video using the screen recording feature on my laptop and used my youtube page to upload the video explaining the features of the project and helped to edit the overview markdown (mainly done by Evan)
