I contributed by attempting to set up a working user profile tab in our application buy
learning from teammates and the examples presented in class. This involves mapping the url to the my_profile.html file, and I got it working. It will probably not be used due to another person in my group who went ahead and did it himself and impplemented it further, but I got the basic idea down and supplied it to my team if they needed it. 

I also contributed with various github orginization problems and had a significant contribution to 
the team write-up portion. This included an overview of the project as well as a write up of what went well and what needs to be imporved on.

Lastly I helped get the youtube video organized in time for the project submission. This included part of the voiceover and decision on what to say in the voiceover.
