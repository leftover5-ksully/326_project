DESCRIPTION: Down the Asile is a web application that allows users to shop a selection of stores and add items from stores to their cart. They can then checkout, get their total, and finally get a map of the store with the most effiecent path with their set of items. 

INSTRUCTIONS: 
  1. After cloning, navigate to the directory 'src/shoppingTwo' in the command line.
  2. Run './init.sh' This will generate mock data and fake users, and will print out the information. (If you get a permission denied          error, run 'chmod u+x init.sh')
  3. To run the server, input 'python3 manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8080', then load up a web browser and go to localhost:8080. 
  4. You're done! Enjoy exploring Down the Asile!

FEATURES:
There is an admin user that can manipulate user permissions and store data. A normal user logged in will not be able to do this and can only view their information in the 'My Profile' section.
 
Thanks for checking it out!
