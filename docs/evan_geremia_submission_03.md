I created the writeup for the project submission and wrote a good amount of it along with mina. I also tested peoples code for bugs when merging everything and found a few. I updated the readme file in master so that it has our proper information and how to run the server. I also suggested additions/modifications and am planning on helping with them for the next submission. 

I tried early on to create a login page but it ended up buggy and not working so it didn't make the cut. 

I also plan on working heavily on the video, both voiceover and preperation for what to show.
