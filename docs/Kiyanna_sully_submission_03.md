I contributed mainly to creating uploading and editing the video considering my laptop has the software to screen record. I suggested a change in the displays of user names instead of being their username, for it to isntead reflect the actual user's first name. Harold and I worked on making this a reality in the application. During the final stages I also ran the application a few times to look over it and check and make sure it worked well, especially the admin functions which with the help of Mina and Harold we were able to get to work relatively well. I also messed around with rendering some of the views but ultimately we went along with other code. 


**late addition due to technical difficulties: laptop died before post uploaded**
